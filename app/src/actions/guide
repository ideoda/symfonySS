folder structure and file name determines the routing as follows:
the routes of the application are determined by the folder structure (with filenames) of the "actions" folder

folders and actionclass format:
/folder1/folder2/MethodActionParam1Param2.php
if "folder2" is the same as "Action" (case insensitive), "folder2" removed

routing generation examples:
